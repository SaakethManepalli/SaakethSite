## Hello ðŸ‘‹

### _Who Am I?_

Currently a Senior at Smithtown High School West, passionate about using low-cost, ordinary, electronics to modernize and connect systems. I have a broad range of experiences, including software development, circuit design using Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, and logistics. I am also dedicated to research, as I wrote a critical analysis paper on recycling programs at various governmental levels. During the culmination of the paper, I utilized multiple visualization softwares to display my data in various forms
 In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an officer of multiple clubs and honor societies, including the Math Honor Society, where I participate in events like Math Fun Night and where I work to improve the scope of the Math Honor Society into various applied Mathematics fields, such as Physics and Engineering. I am also a varsity athlete on both the tennis and track teams and a pianist involved in various music groups. I thrive in environments that challenge my problem-solving abilities and offer opportunities to make impactful contributions, and I am driven to explore the junction of technology and practical applications to drive efficiency and creativity.
